  abstract = {Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions with short revisit times, such as Sentinel-1 and the planned NISAR and Tandem-L, provide an unprecedented wealth of interferometric SAR (InSAR) time series. However, the processing of the emerging Big Data is challenging for state-of-the-art InSAR analysis techniques. This contribution introduces a novel approach, named Sequential Estimator, for efficient estimation of the interferometric phase from long InSAR time series. The algorithm uses recursive estimation and analysis of the data covariance matrix via division of the data into small batches, followed by the compression of the data batches. From each compressed data batch artificial interferograms are formed, resulting in a strong data reduction. Such interferograms are used to link the ``older'' data batches with the most recent acquisitions and thus to reconstruct the phase time series. This scheme avoids the necessity of reprocessing the entire data stack at the face of each new acquisition. The proposed estimator introduces negligible degradation compared to the Cramer-Rao lower bound under realistic coherence scenarios. The estimator may therefore be adapted for high-precision near-real-time processing of InSAR and accommodate the conversion of InSAR from an offline to a monitoring geodetic tool. The performance of the Sequential Estimator is compared to state-of-the-art techniques via simulations and application to Sentinel-1 data.},

  abstract = {Signal decorrelation poses a limitation to multipass SAR interferometry. In pursuit of overcoming this limitation to achieve high-precision deformation estimates, different techniques have been developed, with short baseline subset, SqueeSAR, and CAESAR as the overarching schemes. These different analysis approaches raise the question of their efficiency and limitation in phase and consequently deformation estimation. This contribution first addresses this question and then proposes a new estimator with improved performance, called Eigendecomposition-based Maximum-likelihood-estimator of Interferometric phase (EMI). The proposed estimator combines the advantages of the state-of-the-art techniques. Identical to CAESAR, EMI is solved using eigendecomposition; it is therefore computationally efficient and straightforward in implementation. Similar to SqueeSAR, EMI is a maximum-likelihood-estimator; hence, it retains estimation efficiency. The computational and estimation efficiency of EMI renders it as an optimum choice for phase estimation. A further marriage of EMI with the proposed Sequential Estimator by Ansari et al. provides an efficient processing scheme tailored to the analysis of Big InSAR Data. EMI is formulated and verified in relation to the state-of-the-art approaches via mathematical formulation, simulation analysis, and experiments with time series of Sentinel-1 data over the volcanic island of Vulcano, Italy.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the presence of a new interferometric signal in multilooked synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferograms that cannot be attributed to the atmospheric or Earth-surface topography changes. The observed signal is short-lived and decays with the temporal baseline; however, it is distinct from the stochastic noise attributed to temporal decorrelation. The presence of such a fading signal introduces a systematic phase component, particularly in short temporal baseline interferograms. If unattended, it biases the estimation of Earth surface deformation from SAR time series. Here, the contribution of the mentioned phase component is quantitatively assessed. The biasing impact on the deformation-signal retrieval is further evaluated. A quality measure is introduced to allow the prediction of the associated error with the fading signals. Moreover, a practical solution for the mitigation of this physical signal is discussed; special attention is paid to the efficient processing of Big Data from modern SAR missions such as Sentinel-1 and NISAR. Adopting the proposed solution, the deformation bias is shown to decrease significantly. Based on these analyses, we put forward our recommendations for efficient and accurate deformation-signal retrieval from large stacks of multilooked interferograms.},

  abstract = {Phase artifacts in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images frequently degrade the interpretability of the phase and correlation signatures of terrain. Often, these distortions are attributed to spatially variable ionospheric propagation delays at two different SAR acquisition times. We present here L-band InSAR data from Iceland, California, and Hawaii. The California and Hawaii interferograms show no significant ionospheric artifacts, while the Iceland interferogram shows a maximum misregistration of three pixels in the azimuth direction, which leads to severe phase decorrelation artifacts in the InSAR image. We relate the misregistration of complex pixels seen in the interferograms to the gradient of the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) observed by global positioning system (GPS) data and confirm that indeed the phase artifacts in the Iceland interferogram are due to dispersive ionospheric propagation rather than other decorrelation factors such as neutral atmospheric delays. We develop a method to measure the spatial TEC variation at synthetic aperture length scales using dual-frequency GPS carrier phase data. We solve for the GPS data ambiguities using a low-resolution ionosphere reference derived from either available ionospheric observations or the GPS carrier phase data themselves. GPS observations show directly the level of ionospheric variability, and the spatial TEC gradient as observed by GPS predicts the misregistration of complex pixels in interferograms in all three areas. This confirmation of the cause of the image artifacts suggests that they can be routinely corrected from the InSAR data alone, provided that the sensor measures the change in TEC along the radar swath.},

  abstract = {We describe a python package for nonlinear phase linking of full resolution SAR images using both distributed and persistent scatterers. In the workflow, the first step is to find for each pixel the set of self-similar pixels in order to identify persistent and distributed scatterers. Next the phase linking is performed using the full complex coherence matrix containing the wrapped phase values of each distributed scatterer. Our package uses a hybrid approach consisting of eigenvalue decomposition-based maximum likelihood phase linking and the classic eigenvalue decomposition method. The latter is used for pixels with a non-invertible covariance matrix. A sequential mode achieves computational efficiency. The next step is to unwrap the phase by selecting an opti\- mum unwrapping network of interferograms and invert for the unwrapped phase time-series which is converted to the displacement time-series. We show how the performance of phase linking depends on the temporal cor\- relation behavior using simulations of the coherence matrix. The sequential approaches better retrieve the simulated phases compared to the non-sequential approaches for all temporal coherence models. Phase linking methods retrieve the simulated phase with residuals close to the Cram{\textasciiacute}er{\textendash}Rao lower bound for coherent seasons where the absolute values of coherence matrix are high and provide a tool for obtaining InSAR measurements over areas with seasonal snowfall. We furthermore show that unwrapping errors propagate differently depending on the unwrapping network. For single-reference networks there is no error propagation, but for sequential networks it compromises the accuracy of the final displacement time-series. Delaunay networks provide an optimum solution in terms of accuracy and precision if there are several years of data with frequent temporal decorrelation or strong seasonal decorrelation. We present applications using Sentinel-1 data in different natural and anthropogenic environments.},

  abstract = {Phase decorrelation, caused by changes in the surface scattering properties between two radar acquisitions, is a major limiting factor for interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) surface deformation analysis over vegetated terrain. Persistent Scatterer (PS) techniques have been developed to identify high-quality radar pixels suffering from minimal decorrelation artifacts. However, existing PS selection algorithms are often based on the statistics of InSAR amplitude and phase measurements at each individual radar pixel, and scattering signal models that take into account the phase correlation of nearby PS pixels have not been fully developed. Here, we present a new PS selection algorithm based on the similarity of phase observations between nearby radar pixels. We used this algorithm to analyze 25 C-band Envisat SAR scenes acquired over the San Luis Valley, Colorado, and 93 C-band Sentinel-1 SAR scenes acquired over the Greater Houston area, Texas. At both the test sites, the presence of dense vegetation leads to severe phase decorrelation artifacts even in some interferograms with short temporal baselines. Our algorithm can reduce the number of false positive and false negative PS pixels identified from an existing PS identification algorithm. The improved PS identification accuracy allows us to substantially increase the total number of high-quality interferograms that are suitable for time series analysis. We reconstructed spatially coherent InSAR phase observations through an interpolation between PS pixels, and recovered subtle deformation signals that are otherwise undetectable. In both the cases, the superior performance of our PS processing strategy was demonstrated using a large number of independent ground-truth data.},
