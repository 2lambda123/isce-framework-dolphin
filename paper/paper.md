# Summary

<!-- JOSS welcomes submissions from broadly diverse research areas. For this reason, we require that authors include in the paper some sentences that explain the software functionality and domain of use to a non-specialist reader. We also require that authors explain the research applications of the software. The paper should be between 250-1000 words. Authors submitting papers significantly longer than 1000 words may be asked to reduce the length of their paper. -->

<!-- A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience. -->

`dolphin` is a Python library for creating maps of land surface displacement using the remote sensing technique called Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). Conventional InSAR uses pairs of SAR images to get a single map of the relative displacement between the two acquisition times. Since conventional techniques are prone to multiple noise sources, `dolphin` uses state-of-the-art multi-temporal algorithms to produce long time series of displacement at fine resolution.

# Statement of need
<!-- A Statement of need section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software and places it in the context of related work. -->

The Sentinel-1 satellite from the European Space Agency (ESA) has provided free and open access to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data since 2014. This has led to a rapid increase in the availability of SAR data and has enabled a wide range of applications in Earth and environmental sciences. InSAR has been used to study a wide range of geophysical processes, including earthquakes, volcanic activity, and land subsidence. However, processing InSAR data can be challenging, particularly for large-scale time series analysis, and many existing tools are not designed to run at continental scale in a cloud computing environment.

While phase linking algorithms have been known for over a decade [@Guarnieri2008ExploitationTargetStatistics], until several years ago, there were no open source libraries which could perform combined persistent scatterer (PS) and distributed scatterer (DS) processing techniques known as phase linking. Since [@Ferretti2011NewAlgorithmProcessing] and [@Ansari2018EfficientPhaseEstimation] were not made public, the [`FRInGE`](https://github.com/isce-framework/fringe) library was created as a proof of concept for multiple phase linking algorithms  [@Fattahi2019FRInGEFullResolutionInSAR]. `FRInGE` is a C++ library with Cython bindings to call workflows from Python. Expanding upon these algorithms, [`Miaplpy`](https://github.com/insarlab/MiaplPy) is a Python library which implements the phase linking algorithms in `FRInGE`, as well as new algorithms developed in [@Mirzaee2023NonlinearPhaseLinking]. The MATLAB libary [`TomoSAR`](https://github.com/DinhHoTongMinh/TomoSAR) was also made public in 2022 which implements the "Compressed SAR" (ComSAR) algorithm, a variant of phase linking detailed in [@HoTongMinh2022CompressedSARInterferometry].

`dolphin` has been developed to be used in the Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project. OPERA is a Jet Propulsion Laboratory project funded by the Satellite Needs Working Group (SNWG) tasked with generating a North America Displacement product. The displacement product, covering over 10 million square kilometers of land, has a required latency of < 72 hours; as such, new software was required which could handle the heavy computational demands of the project.

# Overview of Dolphin

`dolphin` has the ability to process stacks of coregistered single-look complex (SLC) radar images into a time series of surface displacement and an average surface velocity over the input time period. The software has pre-made workflows accessible through command line tools which call core algorithms for   PS/DS processing:

- The `shp` subpackage estimates the SAR backscatter distribution to find neighborhoods of statistically homogeneous pixels (SHPs) [@Parizzi2011AdaptiveInSARStack; @Ferretti2011NewAlgorithmProcessing]
- The `phase_link` subpackage processes the complex SAR covariance matrix into a time series of wrapped phase using the CAESAR algorithm [@Fornaro2015CAESARApproachBased], the eigenvalue-based maximum likelihood estimator of interferometric phase (EMI) [@Ansari2018EfficientPhaseEstimation], or the combined phase linking (CPL) approach from [@Mirzaee2023NonlinearPhaseLinking].
- The `unwrap` subpackage exposes multiple phase unwrapping algorithms, including the Statistical-cost, Network-flow Algorithm for Phase Unwrapping (SNAPHU) [@Chen2001TwodimensionalPhaseUnwrapping], the PHASS algorithm (available in the InSAR Scientific Computing Environment)

`dolphin` also includes a basic `timeseries` module to invert an overdetermined network of unwrapped interferograms into a time series and estimate the average surface velocity, as well as an `atmosphere` subpackage for adding tropospheric and ionosphere. The outputs of `dolphin` are also compatible with the Miami INsar Time-series software [@Yunjun2019SmallBaselineInSAR] for users who are already comfortable with MintPy.

While `dolphin` has been primarily tested on CPU-based workstations and cloud environments, the compute-intensive routines leverage the `jax` library for its accelerated linear algebra (XLA) just-in-time compiler [@Bradbury2018JAXComposableTransformations]. This means that with only an extra installation, users can accelerate their processing by 5-20x on machines with a compatible GPU.

The command line tools provide a simple interface for processing large datasets (hundreds of full-frame Sentinel-1 images) with minimal required configuration. As an example, Figure \autoref{fig:mojave} shows the final average surface velocity map created from Sentinel-1 data between February 2017 - December 2020 over the Mojave Desert.
